## Readme
## About the code
This code is designed to preprocess text data for analysis using natural language processing techniques. Specifically, it performs the following steps:

Loads a text corpus from a CSV file.
Removes URLs, punctuation, and special characters from the text data.
Converts all text to lowercase.
Tokenizes the text data using NLTK's word_tokenize function.
Removes stop words from the tokenized text data.
Creates a word cloud visualization of the most frequent words in the text corpus.
## Requirements
The code requires the following Python packages:

pandas
nltk
wordcloud
matplotlib

##### You will also need to download the NLTK stop words resource. To do this, run the following command in a Python shell:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
## How to use the code
Clone this repository or download the preprocess_text.py file.
Install the required packages and download the NLTK stop words resource.
Save your text corpus in a CSV file with a column named OriginalTweet.
Replace the Corona_NLP_test.csv file name in the code with the name of your CSV file.
Run the code in a Python environment.
Output
The code outputs a word cloud visualization of the most frequent words in the text corpus. The visualization is displayed using matplotlib. The code also prints the first few rows of the preprocessed text corpus DataFrame.
